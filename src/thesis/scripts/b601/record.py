"""Record a LeRobot dataset by teleoperating the reBot B601-DM follower with the
reBot Arm 102 leader. Invoked by src/thesis/scripts/b601/record.sh, which resolves
the arm ports and resets the follower's control mode first.

Unlike lerobot-record (fixed --dataset.single_task for the whole session), this
lets you pick a new task after every episode -- type a new one, reuse a previous
one, or keep the current one -- a task picker.

No display_data / rerun / foxglove: this runs headlessly on the B601's Pi, which
has no display server and isn't worth the CPU cost of that kind of visualization.
Recording progress is printed to the terminal instead. What the cameras see is
served as an MJPEG stream (see stream_cameras) that any browser on the network
can open, which costs a downscale and a JPEG encode per streamed frame, with the
follower's state and the leader's commanded action charted underneath it on the
same page (see stream_metrics).

Cameras come entirely from the config's `cameras` dict, in the same shape as
lerobot's own `--robot.cameras='{...}'`: any lerobot camera backend, named and
pointed at whatever that dataset's rig has, with device auto-detection where a
serial/path isn't pinned. See thesis.utils.cameras.build_cameras.

Episodes and scene resets both run until a key ends them, rather than to
lerobot-record's clocks (see RecordConfig.episode_time_s). Between episodes the
follower ramps back to its calibration zero pose and waits for the leader to be
brought back to that pose too, so an episode never opens with the arm snapping
across the workspace to meet the leader.

`dry_run=true` (record.sh --dry-run) teleoperates under the same config and writes
nothing -- same cameras, control mode, rate and stream, no dataset and no upload --
so a rig can be checked before a session is collected on it.

Controls (during recording, via the same keyboard backend as lerobot-record --
arrow keys or n/r/q over SSH):
  Right / n  -> end episode (or end the scene reset)
  Left  / r  -> discard and re-record episode
  Esc   / q  -> stop recording entirely
