"""Precomputed frozen-encoder embeddings, so training never runs the backbone.

A frozen video backbone (VJEPA2) is ~99% of a training step's compute, and every window
it encodes is revisited hundreds of times over a run. `cache_encodings:` (configs/
base.yaml) precomputes each stream's encoder output for every window training can
request -- augmented `augmentation_draws` ways -- and training looks embeddings up
instead of encoding.

The cache is WINDOW-level, never frame- or tubelet-level: the backbone attends across
the whole window it is given (a context window's two tubelets see each other), so a
tubelet encoded alone is NOT the tubelet encoded in its window, and only whole-window
entries reproduce what the live path (validation, robot serving) computes. A window's
frames are a pure function of its (episode, anchor) -- offsets are fixed by the spec and
boundary clamping is deterministic -- so that pair is the cache key.

Layout per stream: `data` uint8 `[N, K, tokens, dim]` quantized per token against fp16
`scale`/`zero` (probe on real towel windows: 2.9% per-token rel-L2, 0.11% dot-product
distortion -- far under one augmentation draw's variation), plus a sorted packed key
array for `searchsorted` lookup. Augmentation parameters are seeded per (episode,
anchor, field, draw): the draw is shared by every stream reading the field, so a
sample's context and future windows keep the same crop -- exactly the live wrapper's
one-draw-per-sample-per-field coherence, quantized to K options per window.

Train-time batches carry `enc_cache/<field>` int64 `(episode, anchor, draw)` keys where
the pixel field would be (see datasets/lerobot.py); the model dispatches on that field's
presence, never on dtypes (algorithms/predictive_model.py).
