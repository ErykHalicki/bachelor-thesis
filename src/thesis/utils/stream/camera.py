"""A stream panel showing already-open lerobot cameras as one merged MJPEG feed.

Peeks at cameras someone else owns and is already reading, rather than opening its
own: frames are taken with `read_latest()`, which copies a reference under the
camera's frame lock and leaves `new_frame_event` alone. `async_read()` would clear
that event and so compete for frames with the real consumer; `read_latest` cannot.
That makes this safe to point at a robot's cameras mid-recording.

One background thread polls every camera in turn, merges the frames side by side and
JPEG-encodes them, exactly as the standalone preview scripts in
src/thesis/debug/hardware/ do -- see stream_lerobot_cameras.py's module docstring for
why the polling is sequential in one thread rather than one per camera. Encoding runs
on another core rather than stalling the owner: OpenCV releases the GIL for the resize
and the encode.
