    stream = start_stream([
        CameraPanel(robot.cameras, height=360, fps=15, quality=95),
        observations := LeRobotObservationPanel(window=300),

`start_stream` never raises and returns None when it can't serve (nothing to show, or
the port is taken), so a preview is never what brings down a recording or a rollout.

Panels are independent. To add one that plots numbers, subclass ChartPanel and return
`line_chart(...)` specs from `charts()` -- no javascript is involved. To add one that
draws some other way, subclass StreamPanel (see server.py) and give its `kind` a
renderer in page.py.
