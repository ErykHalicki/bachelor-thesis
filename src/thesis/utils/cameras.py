    `type` picks the lerobot camera backend by its registered name (`zed`,

    to that backend's config dataclass, so anything lerobot supports is

    `front`, ...) is named by the config rather than by this code. An empty
    config is not an error -- it records robot state with no image streams, and
    an entry whose value is null is dropped (see the loop below).

    Beyond plain lerobot, two device fields are auto-detected when omitted or
    set to "auto": `serial_number` on a zed (all auto zed entries then share the
    one detected camera, which is what lets left/right eyes share a single
    capture) and `index_or_path` on an opencv camera (the lowest-numbered USB
    capture node that is not a ZED's and not already claimed by another entry,
    so several auto webcams resolve to different devices).

    Any zed entries are returned first regardless of their order in the config,
    so Robot.connect() opens them before any UVC camera -- see
    resolve_zed_serial() for why that ordering matters.
