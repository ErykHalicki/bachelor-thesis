"""Generic ViT predictor: one transformer over configurable token streams.

The conditioning/predict spec fully describes the model's interface; stream names are arbitrary
keys. Each predicted stream declares how it is produced, and that is the only paradigm-specific
thing in the model:

    flow    the stream's tokens enter as noise x_t and leave as a velocity; target = x1 - x0.
            A flow-matching DiT.
    direct  the stream adds no tokens: it names an `input` token stream, reads a head off that
            stream's token slice, and regresses the encoded value at its own `index`; the two
            windows are equal length and paired positionally, so input position i predicts
            target i. Autoregressive next-latent regression (LeWorldModel).

Mixing both in one `predict:` block is allowed.

    conditioning:
      video:  { dim: 192, index: "-2..0", grid: [1, 1] }   # via: tokens (default)
      state:  { dim: 6, via: cross }                       # cross-attention source
      action: { dim: 2, via: cond, index: "-2..0" }        # per-frame AdaLN conditioning
    predict:
      video:  { type: direct, input: video, dim: 192, index: "-1..1" }
      action: { type: flow, dim: 2, index: "0..47", fps: 30, block_size: 2 }

Token streams (via: tokens) and flow streams are laid out on one shared time axis in declaration
order, conditioning before predicted. Token counts, RoPE positions and the block-causal mask all
derive from each stream's index/fps/grid/block_size.

Attention is unmasked by default (`model.causal: false`, `model.clean_attends_noisy: true`), so
`block_size` only means something once `causal: true` is set. A `direct` stream requires it: its
input window overlaps its own target window, so unmasked the token at index i reads the clean
encoded observation at i + 1, the very value it is trained to predict.

AdaLN conditioning is a concatenation of fixed slots (timestep first when any stream is flow,
then one per `via: cond` stream), zeroed where a slot does not apply -- in particular the
timestep slot on the tokens of any direct stream's `input`, so `t` never reaches the direct
path. With no cond and no direct streams the cond stays (B, model_dim).

A predicted stream's projections into and out of the trunk are `token_in`/`token_out`:
DreamZero's MLP pair by default -- action, state and vision-latent tokens alike, whether flow
or direct -- which concatenates the timestep onto the tokens at the input. adaLN
(InputLayer/FinalLayer) is still available by declaring it explicitly. Clean/conditioning
streams (`via: tokens`) enter through the same MLP lift, minus the timestep concatenation:
they are never denoised, so `t` has nothing to tell them. See docs/.claude/config-spec.md.

    """GenericViTTrunk plus the encoders that feed it.

    loss(batch) builds a per-call context (encoder latents, predictions, targets) via the base
    and sums the configured `losses:` terms. The pred/target rule is generic: a flow stream is
    seeded with noise -- or, when it declares a `source:` block, with its A2A seed (a history
    window or a context latent, see PredictiveModel.build_flow_seeds) -- and targets x1 - x0,
    a direct stream reads its input stream's tokens and targets its own encoded window.
    predict(obs) / rollout_latent(...) integrate the flow streams from the same start, or run
    a single deterministic forward when nothing is flow. No path here is stop-gradded: a
    jointly trained encoder is shaped by the flow loss through both x0 and x1, and collapse
    is held off by the terms that ground the latent (`ae_recon`, `sigreg`), not by cutting
    gradients.

    An `integration` loss term additionally runs that same solve WITH gradients during
    training (`_forward_integrate`), so the sampler's endpoint -- not just the velocity at a
    random t -- is supervised, at the cost of `num_steps` extra trunk passes per step.
