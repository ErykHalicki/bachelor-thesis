    the model never sees a backend-specific dataset type.

    Batch fields are keyed by the modality spec's `from` values (entry name if `from`
    is omitted). A field read by several spec entries carries the sorted union of
    their index windows, ascending in time; the algorithm slices each entry's window
    back out. Float columns are float32. Full contract: docs/.claude/config-spec.md.

    `provided_modalities` advertises what this source supplies, so an experiment can
    fail fast at build time if the algorithm needs a field the data lacks.
