    reads the batch field named by its `from` key (default: the entry name), a window of
    relative step offsets around a sampled decision point t=0. A field read by several
    entries carries the sorted union of their windows, and each entry slices its own
    window back out (see algorithms/predictive_model.py).

    Backed by `lerobot.datasets.LeRobotDataset`, whose `delta_timestamps` returns each
    requested column as an ascending `(T, ...)` window, so step offsets map to seconds
    via the dataset fps. A `"last"` entry in a spec index is not an offset: it resolves
    to the final frame of the sample's episode (a goal frame) and is appended as the last
    row of that field's tensor. Loads from `cfg.root` if given, otherwise the HF cache,
    downloading `cfg.repo_id` on first use.

    Config knobs:
      repo_id        HF dataset id (e.g. `lerobot/pusht`). Required.
      root           local dataset dir; overrides the HF cache/download path.
      revision       dataset revision/tag (default: the codebase version).
      episodes       list of episode indices to keep; null uses all.
      tasks          list of instruction strings to keep the episodes of; null uses all.
                     Composes with `episodes` (intersection) and with the split.
      validation_split
                     fraction of episodes held out of training for offline validation.
                     Applied within `episodes` when that is also set.
      validation_split_seed
                     the draw for that split. Training and validation must agree on it
                     or the two halves overlap.
      columns        `{from_key: lerobot_column}` remap; default identity.
      slices         `{from_key: patterns}` keeping only some dimensions of a flat column,
                     named by the dataset's per-dimension feature names (e.g. `"*.pos"`,
                     `"gripper.pos, *.vel"`).
      image_size     `[H, W]` to resize visual streams to; null keeps native size.
      return_uint8   uint8 [0,255] images (default); false gives float [0,1].
      drop_boundary  drop decision points whose window would run past the end of its
                     episode (default true). The start of an episode is never dropped:
                     offsets before it clamp onto its first frame.
