    wraps the source so training sees normalized data (see utils/normalize.py); if
    `cfg.augment` is set, wraps that in turn so training sees augmented data
    (see utils/augment.py).

    `norm_stats_override`, if given, is used as-is instead of recomputing stats from this
    dataset -- pass a checkpoint's own `norm_stats` when resuming, so a run stays
    consistent with the stats it was originally trained with.

    `augment=False` builds the same source without the augmentation wrapper, for the
    callers that want the data as recorded (held-out eval, modality checks).

    `split="train"` / `"val"` keeps only that side of the episode partition
    `cfg.validation_split` defines; None keeps every episode.

    `subsample` is the root `subsample_streams:` config (anchor thinning) and
    `cache_fields`/`cache_draws` put the source in encoding-cache mode: those fields are
    served as `enc_cache/<field>` window keys instead of pixels, and their augmentation
    patterns are dropped from the wrapper here because the draws are baked into the
    cache (utils/enc_cache.py). Both are lerobot-only.
